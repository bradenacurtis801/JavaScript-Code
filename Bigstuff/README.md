**Assignment: bigstuff_v1**
  Problem:
  Running out of disk space? Need to quickly identify large files and directories for cleanup? Develop an app that prints the directory tree with sizes, helping you identify candidates for manual deletion.
  
  Solution:
  Your app analyzes the file system, displaying directory sizes and sizes of individual files. Command-line arguments customize behavior: sort order, size units, minimum size, and more.
  
  Requirements:
  
  Print directory tree with sizes.
  Customize behavior with command-line arguments.
  
**Assignment: bigstuff_v2**
  Problem:
  Enhance your app to provide more user-friendly features, including color-coded output, internationalization (i18n), and better error handling.
  
  Solution:
  Your enhanced app displays colored output for directories and files, supports different languages and locales, and handles errors gracefully.
  
  New Features:
  
  Colored output using chalk.js.
  Internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) support.
  Improved error handling with user-friendly messages.
  Assignment: bigstuff_v3
  Problem:
  Further improve your app by adding advanced features, including globbing and configuration file support.
  
  Solution:
  Your advanced app supports globbing to include/exclude specific files and directories and allows users to specify default options via a configuration file.
  
  New Features:
  
  Globbing support using glob.js.
  Configuration file support for default options.
  These assignments build upon each other, starting with a basic version that identifies large files and directories, and progressively adding more features to make the app more versatile and user-friendly.
